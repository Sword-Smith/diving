SSI Dry Suit Course
Section 1
Objectives

1. Understand physiological effects of cold water on the diver
2. List the benefits of using a dry suit
3. State the cost effectiveness of diving in a dry suit

Better visibility in cold water
Access to new marine life not found in tropical waters

Icing on regulator happens because of the 1st Law of Thermodynamics
External ising can happen if a lot of air is consumed at high rates,
and the water is cold. Breathing slowly can reduce the risk of this
happening.

Internal icing is usually caused by too much humidity in the cylinder
air.

Warmth is more than a matter of comfort, it also affects safety.

When you become chilled, the body reduces blood circulation in the
extremities, and this increases the risk of nitrogen becoming trapped
there.

Wearing a drysuit reduces fatigue since the effects of hypothermia are
reduced.

- More comfortable to remove a drysuit than a wetsuit
- Drysuits tend to last longer than wetsuits
- Divers in drysuits can make more dives per day
- Neck and wrist seals keep the diver dry

Section 2
Selecting Your Dry Suit 

1. Understand the important features to look for when selecting a dry suit
2. State the benefits of different dry suit materials
3. Be able to describe the various features available on dry suits
4. Identify the importance of a properly fitting dry suit and how fit differs according to dry suit types

Common types of drysuit material
- Closed cell neoprene - same material as wet suits, have high buoyancy, so require much weight
- Compressed neoprene - Better stretch than crushed neoprene.
- Crushed neoprene - Thick neoprene, coated with nylon. Good resistance to tear and retains some stretch.
- Vulcanized rubber - Good stretch, easy to repair.
- Try-butyl laminate material
- Nylon fabric material - Little to no stretch
- Dual-layer dry suits - Very flexible

Features
Drysuits can have attached boots or gloves. This reduces potential places
for leaks. Suspenders are nice.

- Length of suit is key to good fit.
- Every seal on dry suit is a potential source of leakage.
- Seals are typically made of latex
- Crushed neoprene dry suits, when coated with nylon, has good resistance to cuts and tears

Section 3
Selecting Your Dry Suit Valves 

1. Understand how the various types of inflator valves function, and the benefit of each
2. Describe various inflator hose types and configurations
3. State how the various types of exhaust valves work, and the benefits of each

There are inflator valves and exhaust valves.

By pressing the breast valve, the suit is inflated.

Three different kinds of exhaust valves:
- Manual exhaust valves - can only exhaust in upright position, opened by hand, close automatically.
- Manual power exhaust valves - Integrated with the inflator mechanism
- Automatic exhaust valves - vents automatically, needs to be adjusted.

Exhaust valves are usually located on upper arm
- The most important consideration regarding your suit inflator hose is the length of the hose relative to the distance between your regulator first-stage and: 
The suit inflator valve

Section 4
Your Dry Suit Accessories 

1) Importance of dry suit undergarment
2) Different types of hoods
3) Types of boots and gloves
4) Describe buoyancy control configurations
5) Equipment configurations and adaptations

A dry suit keeps you dry, the insulation keeps you warm.
Materials used:
1) Synthetic pile - rapidly lose their insulation capability underwater, can produce lint to block exhaust valves
2) Thinsulate - Good isolator, even when wet, needs to be properly laundered
3) Open cell foam - Keeps insulating properties at depth, no linting problems, loses insulating properties when wet, less buoyancy than other materials.
4) Polyester synthetic wool with aluminized backing - 
5) Polypropylene

Open cell foam represents one of the best values in dry suit underwear.
Argon gas can increase insulation.
Nitrox increases material corrosion.

Half of body head is lost through head if not insulated.

Drysuits should have boots attached.

Pockets can be glued to dry suits. Cylinder hoses should not cross pocket.

Buoyancy Compensator (BC/BCD) must be worn with the dry suits

Dry suits usually have more buoyancy than wet suits.
A dry suit can have its own weithting system.

Section 5
Using Your Dry Suit
1) Proper dressing procedures
2) Proper diving procedures
3) Identify common buoyancy problems and techniques to correct them
4) Proper removal of dry suit after dive

It is very important that neck seal is adjusted correctly as it can restrict blod to the brain,
causing the diver to pass out.
Most dry suit leaks are due to poorly adjusted seals.

Ascending in a drysuit is more complicated than with wet suit + BCD.
Venting should be done as you ascend and the air in the dry suit expands.

Buoyancy problems can be alleviated by diving with a minimum amount of
air in your suit.

To quickly reduce buoyancy, turn your knees to your chest and use your arms to
roll over and right yourself.

Buoyancy can result from
1) Sudden flooding
2) Excessive air in the suit
3) Inflator valve gets stuck in open position -- disconnect the inlet hose and dump excessive air.

Emergency air ditching can be done through wrist seal

If you find yourself upside down, tuck your knees to your chest and use arms to roll over. Dump
air when upright.

Exercises:

Exercises

1) Use the buoyancy compensator on the surface for surface flotation. When resting on the surface before or after the dive, practice letting most of the air out of your suit so you are still warm and comfortable, and then inflating your buoyancy compensator until you achieve positive buoyancy.
2) Descend to a depth without inflating your suit until you experience the feeling of a “squeeze”. When you do add air to the suit, add just enough to eliminate the squeeze. This exercise will also help you fine-tune the weighting for your suit.
3) Adjust your buoyancy until you are neutrally buoyant and able to hover motionless at depth. This exercise may take quite a bit of time until you have achieved the right amount of air in your suit and buoyancy compensator.
4) While neutrally buoyant at depth, operate both the inflation and deflation valves simultaneously to determine if the suit can vent air faster than is introduced into the suit. It will be necessary to have the exhaust valve at the highest point when you begin this exercise. Be prepared to dump excess air from a wrist seal if you start drifting upward.
5) Simulate an inflator valve stuck in the open position by depressing the inflation valve for several seconds, then disconnect the inlet hose and vent the excess air from the suit.
6) Maintain near-neutral buoyancy throughout a slow, controlled ascent, stop at 3 meters and hover at that depth motionless for one minute. Some weight adjustment may be required.
7) In a head-down position, slowly and intentionally add air to the suit at depth until you just begin to drift upward. Develop the ability to swim down, right yourself and dump air from the suit. Practice righting yourself by means of a somersault (bending forward) and by arching your back and performing a backward flip.

1) Again, add air to your suit at depth until you just begin to drift upward, then pull your knees to your chest and maneuver yourself into a position where your arms and legs can be extended to achieve a spread-eagle position. Breathe continuously and ride out the ascent to experience what to do for a complete loss of buoyancy control. This exercise should be performed in shallow water (no more than 5 to 6 meters deep), so decompression sickness stemming from a rate of ascent greater than 9 meters per minute will not pose a threat. This must be done during the first dive of the day, and not midway through a multi-day diving trip.
2) With your eyes closed while kneeling on the bottom in 3 meters of water, have your buddy release your weight belt. See if you can catch it before it drops free, and also see if you can right yourself and recover it before you float to the surface. Remember to exhale continuously if you should float to the surface

Keep suit out of sun.
Preferred method for venting suit out of water is through the exhaust valve.
Most dry suit leaks are due to improperly adjusted seals.
Before closing the zipper of your dry suit, you should double check your neck seal
When diving with a drysuit, your scuba unit should be donned: Like a jacket while you are seated or while your buddy holds it
Neck seal trimming prior to first dive with suit is important

Section 6
Caring for Your Dry Suit 
1) Describe proper maintenance procedures
2) Understand varuios repair techniques for various types of dry suits

Rinse drysuit with freshwater
lubricate zippers with parafin wax
was latex with talcum powders, no perfume. Soapy water can also be used.

Remove lint from valves if using woolly bear underwear

Most dry suit leaks are due to diver error rather than damage to the suit

Waterproof tape can be placed on the inside of the suit over the damaged area, from the inside.

To remove accumulated dirt and other foreign matter, dry suit valves should be periodically flushed with:
Clean fresh water through the valve mechanism

To protect them from ozone during storage and to aid in donning at the dive site, latex wrist and neck seals should be dusted with:
Pure talcum powder
